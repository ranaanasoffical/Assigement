Question 1: Class Attendance using a List
You are keeping track of student attendance using a list. Sometimes students may enter their names more than once.

Step 1: Create a list called attendance_list with the names:

["Anas", "Touqeer", "Saad", "Faraz", "Rehan", "Jabbar"]

Step 2: Print the list to see the attendance.

Step 3: Count how many names (including duplicates) are in the list and print the total number.


# Solution 1:
# Creating the attendance list
attendance_list = ["Anas", "Touqeer", "Saad", "Faraz", "Rehan", "Jabbar"]

# Printing the attendance list
print("Attendance List:", attendance_list)

# Counting the total number of names in the list (including duplicates)
print("Total number of names (including duplicates):", len(attendance_list))
     
Attendance List: ['Anas', 'Touqeer', 'Saad', 'Faraz', 'Rehan', 'Jabbar']
Total number of names (including duplicates): 6
Question 2: Unique Attendance using a Set
To find out how many unique students attended the class, use a set. A set automatically removes duplicates.

Step 1: Convert the attendance_list from Question 1 into a set.
Step 2: Print the set to see the unique student names.
Step 3: Count and print the total number of unique students.

# Solution 2:
# Converting the attendance list to a set to remove duplicates
unique_attendance_set = set(attendance_list)

# Printing the unique attendance set
print("Unique Attendance List:", unique_attendance_set)

# Counting the total number of unique students
print("Total number of unique students:", len(unique_attendance_set))

     
Unique Attendance List: {'Anas', 'Touqeer', 'Saad', 'Faraz'}
Total number of unique students: 4
Question 3: Storing Attendance Permanently with a Tuple
A tuple is used when you don’t want the list to change. Let’s store the attendance in a tuple.

Step 1: Create a tuple called attendance_tuple with these names:

("Anas", "Touqeer", "Saad", "Faraz")

Step 2: Print the tuple to display the names


# Solution 3:
# Creating a tuple called attendance_tuple
attendance_tuple = ("Anas", "Touqeer", "Saad", "Faraz")

# Printing the attendance tuple to display the names
print("Attendance Tuple:", attendance_tuple)

     
Attendance Tuple: ('Anas', 'touqeer', 'Saad', 'Faraz')
Question 4: Count Attendance using a Dictionary
You want to count how many times each student attended the class.

Step 1: Using the attendance_list from Question 1, create a dictionary where each student's name is a key, and the number of times they attended is the value.
Step 2: Print the dictionary to see each student's attendance count.

# Solution 4:
# Creating a dictionary to count each student's attendance from attendance_list
attendance_dict = {}
for student in attendance_list:
  if student in attendance_dict:
        attendance_dict[student] += 1
  else:
        attendance_dict[student] = 1

# Step 2: Printing the dictionary to see each student's attendance count
print("Attendance Dictionary:", attendance_dict)

     
Attendance Dictionary: {'Anas': 2, 'Touqeer': 2, 'Saad': 1, 'Faraz': 1}
That was it for my Assignment 2 of DSMP Fellowship. It included concepts like lists, sets, tuples and dictionaries in python and differnts
